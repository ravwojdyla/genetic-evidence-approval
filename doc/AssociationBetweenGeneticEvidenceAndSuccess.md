### Effect of Genetic Evidence on Test Sets










  













![Estimated effect of evidence from human genetic studies on the probability of advancing in clinical development.  A: Partitioning Pharmaprojects, OMIM, and GWAS Catalog into training data available to Nelson et al. 2015 and validation sets.  We use validation set Pipeline Progression (which drugs advanced > 2013) to determine whether gene target-indication pairs with genetic evidence were more likely to advance to the next pipeline phase from 2013-2018.  B:  Our estimates of the effect of genetic evidence on gene target-indication pair progression compared to values reported by Nelson et al. 2015 in validation sets New Pipeline (drugs and indications > 2013, 2013 inactive drugs) New Genetic (only new genetic information > 2013) Pipeline Progression, and in the full updated dataset (Full Data).](figure/HeldOutTestSets-1.png)



### Statistical Models
